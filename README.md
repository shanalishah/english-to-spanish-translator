# English to Spanish Translator

This project implements an English-to-Spanish **neural machine translation system** using a custom-trained **Transformer model** in TensorFlow.  
The model is deployed with a **Streamlit** interface, allowing users to input English text and receive instant Spanish translations.

## Highlights
- **Transformer Architecture** - Multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward layers.
- **Custom Training** - Trained on Englishâ€“Spanish sentence pairs.
- **Pre-Trained Model** - Loads saved weights and vectorizers directly from Google Drive.
- **Interactive App** - Streamlit-powered UI for real-time translation.
  
## Tech Stack
