# English to Spanish Translator

This project implements an English-to-Spanish neural machine translation system using a custom-trained **Transformer** model in **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The model is deployed with a **Streamlit** interface, allowing users to input English text and receive instant Spanish translations.

## Highlights
- **Transformer Architecture** - Multi-head attention, positional encoding, and feed-forward layers.  
- **Custom Training** - Trained on Englishâ€“Spanish sentence pairs.  
- **Pre-Trained Model** - Loads saved weights and vectorizers directly from **GitHub Releases**.  
- **Interactive App** - Streamlit-powered UI for real-time translation: https://english-to-spanish-translator.streamlit.app

## Tech Stack
Python - TensorFlow - Keras - Streamlit - NumPy - Requests
